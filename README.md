# make-it-rain
This is a little project showing the use of the basics Android. It allows a user to press a button and see his bank account increasing and at some point in time gets a message saying he's becoming rich.

It has an example of log.d to write logs. You can then view the logs in logcat by seaching for the TAG.

It shows uses of findViewById, which is a method that finds the view from the layout resource file that are attached with current Activity.

It shows how to apply constraints in the xml file as well as how to reference text from the strings.xml.

As a little fun, it also shows implementation of a Toast, which is used for providing simple feedback about an operation in a small popup.

Feel free to build up on this project if you want to and create PRs which I will then review.
